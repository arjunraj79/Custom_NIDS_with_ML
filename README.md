Project Overview: This project aims to create a custom NIDS that can detect various types of network attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), port scanning, and unauthorized access, by analyzing network traffic data. The system will use a machine learning model trained on a dataset of labeled network traffic to identify suspicious patterns.
Installation: Steps for setting up the project locally.  Use the requirements.txt file and install the required python libraries.
Do create an virtual environment 
>python -m venv venv

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?

add a database csv file , 

To get started, you'll need to download the dataset and place it in a data/ folder within your project directory. Here are the steps to follow:

For the NSL-KDD dataset:

Download the NSL-KDD dataset from the Kaggle website.
Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder named data within your project directory.
The dataset should be in a CSV file named KDDTest+.csv or KDDTrain+.csv. You can rename it to NSL-KDD.csv for simplicity.
For the CICIDS2017 dataset:

Download the CICIDS2017 dataset from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity website.
Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder named data within your project directory.
The dataset should be in a CSV file named Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos.pcap_ISCX.csv or similar. You can rename it to CICIDS2017.csv for simplicity.
Once you've downloaded and placed the dataset in the data/ folder, you can modify the load_data function to load the dataset correctly.

Model Details: Information about the machine learning model, including training process and evaluation metrics.
Limitations: Any known limitations or future improvements can be raised .
Vs code needs to run in admin mode for some features to run.


For the real-time intrusion detection component, you'll need to ensure that:

Network Traffic Capture:

scapy requires access to network interfaces, which might require administrative privileges.
Ensure that no other process is using the network interface in a way that could interfere with packet capture.
Simulating Network Traffic:

You can use tools like nmap to generate traffic for testing your NIDS.
For example, in a separate terminal window, you can run:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sS <your_local_ip>
This will simulate a SYN scan, and your NIDS should detect it as a potential intrusion.
